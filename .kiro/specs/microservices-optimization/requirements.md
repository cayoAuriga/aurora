# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves transforming the existing monolithic Aurora application into a microservices architecture to improve scalability, maintainability, and deployment flexibility. The current application uses FastAPI with CQRS pattern and handles syllabus management functionality. The microservices optimization will decompose the monolith into independent, loosely-coupled services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to be decomposed into independent microservices, so that I can scale individual components based on demand and deploy updates without affecting the entire system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is deployed THEN each microservice SHALL run as an independent process with its own database
2. WHEN a microservice fails THEN other microservices SHALL continue to operate normally
3. WHEN scaling is needed THEN individual microservices SHALL be scalable independently without affecting others
4. WHEN deploying updates THEN each microservice SHALL be deployable independently without downtime to other services

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear service boundaries and communication protocols, so that I can develop and maintain services independently with well-defined interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services communicate THEN they SHALL use standardized REST APIs or message queues
2. WHEN a service interface changes THEN it SHALL maintain backward compatibility or use versioning
3. WHEN services need to share data THEN they SHALL use well-defined data contracts and schemas
4. WHEN developing a service THEN it SHALL have its own codebase, dependencies, and configuration

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want containerized microservices with orchestration support, so that I can deploy, monitor, and manage the distributed system effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying services THEN each microservice SHALL be containerized using Docker
2. WHEN orchestrating services THEN the system SHALL support container orchestration platforms like Docker Compose or Kubernetes
3. WHEN monitoring the system THEN each service SHALL expose health check endpoints
4. WHEN services start THEN they SHALL register themselves and discover other services automatically

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want centralized configuration and logging, so that I can manage service configurations and troubleshoot issues across the distributed system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services start THEN they SHALL load configuration from a centralized configuration service or environment variables
2. WHEN services log events THEN logs SHALL be aggregated in a centralized logging system
3. WHEN debugging issues THEN logs SHALL include correlation IDs to trace requests across services
4. WHEN configuration changes THEN services SHALL be able to reload configuration without restart where possible

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want an API Gateway pattern implemented, so that clients have a single entry point and cross-cutting concerns are handled centrally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN clients make requests THEN they SHALL go through a single API Gateway endpoint
2. WHEN handling requests THEN the API Gateway SHALL route requests to appropriate microservices
3. WHEN processing requests THEN the API Gateway SHALL handle authentication, rate limiting, and request/response transformation
4. WHEN services are unavailable THEN the API Gateway SHALL implement circuit breaker patterns and fallback mechanisms

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want each microservice to have its own database, so that services are truly independent and can choose appropriate data storage technologies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a microservice needs data THEN it SHALL access only its own dedicated database
2. WHEN services need to share data THEN they SHALL communicate through APIs or events, not direct database access
3. WHEN choosing storage THEN each service SHALL be free to choose the most appropriate database technology for its needs
4. WHEN maintaining data consistency THEN the system SHALL implement eventual consistency patterns where needed

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want asynchronous communication between services, so that services remain loosely coupled and the system can handle high loads efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services need to communicate asynchronously THEN they SHALL use message queues or event streaming
2. WHEN events occur THEN services SHALL publish events that other services can subscribe to
3. WHEN processing events THEN services SHALL handle events idempotently to ensure data consistency
4. WHEN the message broker is unavailable THEN services SHALL implement retry mechanisms and dead letter queues

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive testing strategies for microservices, so that I can ensure system reliability and catch integration issues early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing services THEN each service SHALL have unit tests, integration tests, and contract tests
2. WHEN testing service interactions THEN the system SHALL support consumer-driven contract testing
3. WHEN deploying services THEN automated end-to-end tests SHALL verify critical user journeys
4. WHEN services change THEN backward compatibility SHALL be verified through automated testing
